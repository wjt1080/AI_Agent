      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are now highly capable at a diverse range of tasks. This paper studies whether or not GPT-4, one such LLM, is capable of assisting researchers in the field of adversarial machine learning. As a case study, we evaluate the robustness of AI-Guardian, a recent defense to adversarial examples published at IEEE S&P 2023, a top computer security conference. We completely break this defense: the proposed scheme does not increase robustness compared to an undefended baseline.\nWe write none of the code to attack this model, and instead prompt GPT-4 to implement all attack algorithms following our instructions and guidance. This process was surprisingly effective and efficient, with the language model at times producing code from ambiguous instructions faster than the author of this paper could have done. We conclude by discussing (1) the warning signs present in the evaluation that suggested to us AI-Guardian would be broken, and (2) our experience with designing attacks and performing novel research using the most recent advances in language modeling.",

      "abstract": "The capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied in the context of table representation learning. The recently proposed tabular language models (TaLMs) have reported state-of-the-art results across various tasks for table interpretation. However, a closer look into the datasets commonly used for evaluation reveals an entity leakage from the train set into the test set. Motivated by this observation, we explore adversarial attacks that represent a more realistic inference setup. Adversarial attacks on text have been shown to greatly affect the performance of LLMs, but currently, there are no attacks targeting TaLMs. In this paper, we propose an evasive entity-swap attack for the column type annotation (CTA) task. Our CTA attack is the first black-box attack on tables, where we employ a similarity-based sampling strategy to generate adversarial examples. The experimental results show that the proposed attack generates up to a 70% drop in performance.",

      "abstract": "With the emergence of more powerful large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, in-context learning (ICL) has gained significant prominence in leveraging these models for specific tasks by utilizing data-label pairs as precondition prompts. While incorporating demonstrations can greatly enhance the performance of LLMs across various tasks, it may introduce a new security concern: attackers can manipulate only the demonstrations without changing the input to perform an attack. In this paper, we investigate the security concern of ICL from an adversarial perspective, focusing on the impact of demonstrations. We propose a novel attack method named advICL, which aims to manipulate only the demonstration without changing the input to mislead the models. Our results demonstrate that as the number of demonstrations increases, the robustness of in-context learning would decrease. Additionally, we also identify the intrinsic property of the demonstrations is that they can be used (prepended) with different inputs. As a result, it introduces a more practical threat model in which an attacker can attack the test input example even without knowing and manipulating it. To achieve it, we propose the transferable version of advICL, named Transferable-advICL. Our experiment shows that the adversarial demonstration generated by Transferable-advICL can successfully attack the unseen test input examples. We hope that our study reveals the critical security risks associated with ICL and underscores the need for extensive research on the robustness of ICL, particularly given its increasing significance in the advancement of LLMs.",

      "abstract": "Several years of research have shown that machine-learning systems are vulnerable to adversarial examples, both in theory and in practice. Until now, such attacks have primarily targeted visual models, exploiting the gap between human and machine perception. Although text-based models have also been attacked with adversarial examples, such attacks struggled to preserve semantic meaning and indistinguishability. In this paper, we explore a large class of adversarial examples that can be used to attack text-based models in a black-box setting without making any human-perceptible visual modification to inputs. We use encoding-specific perturbations that are imperceptible to the human eye to manipulate the outputs of a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems from neural machine-translation pipelines to web search engines. We find that with a single imperceptible encoding injection -- representing one invisible character, homoglyph, reordering, or deletion -- an attacker can significantly reduce the performance of vulnerable models, and with three injections most models can be functionally broken. Our attacks work against currently-deployed commercial systems, including those produced by Microsoft and Google, in addition to open source models published by Facebook, IBM, and HuggingFace. This novel series of attacks presents a significant threat to many language processing systems: an attacker can affect systems in a targeted manner without any assumptions about the underlying model. We conclude that text-based NLP systems require careful input sanitization, just like conventional applications, and that given such systems are now being deployed rapidly at scale, the urgent attention of architects and operators is required.",

In this paper we investigate the vulnerability of BERT models to variation in input data for Named Entity Recognition (NER) through adversarial attack. Experimental results show that BERT models are vulnerable to variation in the entity context with 20.2 to 45.0% of entities predicted completely wrong and another 29.3 to 53.3% of entities predicted wrong partially. BERT models seem most vulnerable to changes in the local context of entities and often a single change is sufficient to fool the model. The domain-specific BERT model trained from scratch (SciBERT) is more vulnerable than the original BERT model or the domain-specific model that retains the BERT vocabulary (BioBERT). We also find that BERT models are particularly vulnerable to emergent entities. Our results chart the vulnerabilities of BERT models for NER and emphasize the importance of further research into uncovering and reducing these weaknesses.",

Most existing studies focused on designing attacks to evaluate the robustness of NLP models in the English language alone. Literature has seen an increasing need for NLP solutions for other languages. We, therefore, ask one natural question whether state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack methods generalize to other languages. This paper investigates how to adapt SOTA adversarial attack algorithms in English to the Chinese language. Our experiments show that attack methods previously applied to English NLP can generate high-quality adversarial examples in Chinese when combined with proper text segmentation and linguistic constraints. In addition, we demonstrate that the generated adversarial examples can achieve high fluency and sentiment consistency by focusing on the Chinese language\u2019s morphology and phonology, which in turn can be used to improve the adversarial robustness of Chinese NLP models.",

      "authors": "Xiangyu Qi, Yi Zeng, Tinghao Xie, Pin-Yu Chen, Ruoxi Jia, Prateek Mittal, Peter Henderson",
      "abstract": "Optimizing large language models (LLMs) for downstream use cases often involves the customization of pre-trained LLMs through further fine-tuning. Meta's open release of Llama models and OpenAI's APIs for fine-tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo on custom datasets also encourage this practice. But, what are the safety costs associated with such custom fine-tuning? We note that while existing safety alignment infrastructures can restrict harmful behaviors of LLMs at inference time, they do not cover safety risks when fine-tuning privileges are extended to end-users. Our red teaming studies find that the safety alignment of LLMs can be compromised by fine-tuning with only a few adversarially designed training examples. For instance, we jailbreak GPT-3.5 Turbo's safety guardrails by fine-tuning it on only 10 such examples at a cost of less than $0.20 via OpenAI's APIs, making the model responsive to nearly any harmful instructions. Disconcertingly, our research also reveals that, even without malicious intent, simply fine-tuning with benign and commonly used datasets can also inadvertently degrade the safety alignment of LLMs, though to a lesser extent. These findings suggest that fine-tuning aligned LLMs introduces new safety risks that current safety infrastructures fall short of addressing -- even if a model's initial safety alignment is impeccable, it is not necessarily to be maintained after custom fine-tuning. We outline and critically analyze potential mitigations and advocate for further research efforts toward reinforcing safety protocols for the custom fine-tuning of aligned LLMs.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of generating obstinate (over-stability) adversarial examples by word substitution in NLP, where input text is meaningfully changed but the model's prediction does not, even though it should. Previous word substitution approaches have predominantly focused on manually designed antonym-based strategies for generating obstinate adversarial examples, which hinders its application as these strategies can only find a subset of obstinate adversarial examples and require human efforts. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce a novel word substitution method named GradObstinate, a gradient-based approach that automatically generates obstinate adversarial examples without any constraints on the search space or the need for manual design principles. To empirically evaluate the efficacy of GradObstinate, we conduct comprehensive experiments on five representative models (Electra, ALBERT, Roberta, DistillBERT, and CLIP) finetuned on four NLP benchmarks (SST-2, MRPC, SNLI, and SQuAD) and a language-grounding benchmark (MSCOCO). Extensive experiments show that our proposed GradObstinate generates more powerful obstinate adversarial examples, exhibiting a higher attack success rate compared to antonym-based methods. Furthermore, to show the transferability of obstinate word substitutions found by GradObstinate, we replace the words in four representative NLP benchmarks with their obstinate substitutions. Notably, obstinate substitutions exhibit a high success rate when transferred to other models in black-box settings, including even GPT-3 and ChatGPT. Examples of obstinate adversarial examples found by GradObstinate are available at this https URL.",

However, few efforts have sought to identify which source samples are the most attackable or robust, i.e. can we determine for an unseen target model, which samples are the most vulnerable to an adversarial attack. This work formally extends the definition of sample attackability/robustness for NLP attacks. Experiments on two popular NLP datasets, four state of the art models and four different NLP adversarial attack methods, demonstrate that sample uncertainty is insufficient for describing characteristics of attackable/robust samples and hence a deep learning based detector can perform much better at identifying the most attackable and robust samples for an unseen target model. Nevertheless, further analysis finds that there is little agreement in which samples are considered the most attackable/robust across different NLP attack methods, explaining a lack of portability of attackability detection methods across attack methods.",

      "abstract": "Because \"out-of-the-box\" large language models are capable of generating a great deal of objectionable content, recent work has focused on aligning these models in an attempt to prevent undesirable generation. While there has been some success at circumventing these measures -- so-called \"jailbreaks\" against LLMs -- these attacks have required significant human ingenuity and are brittle in practice. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective attack method that causes aligned language models to generate objectionable behaviors. Specifically, our approach finds a suffix that, when attached to a wide range of queries for an LLM to produce objectionable content, aims to maximize the probability that the model produces an affirmative response (rather than refusing to answer). However, instead of relying on manual engineering, our approach automatically produces these adversarial suffixes by a combination of greedy and gradient-based search techniques, and also improves over past automatic prompt generation methods.\nSurprisingly, we find that the adversarial prompts generated by our approach are quite transferable, including to black-box, publicly released LLMs. Specifically, we train an adversarial attack suffix on multiple prompts (i.e., queries asking for many different types of objectionable content), as well as multiple models (in our case, Vicuna-7B and 13B). When doing so, the resulting attack suffix is able to induce objectionable content in the public interfaces to ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude, as well as open source LLMs such as LLaMA-2-Chat, Pythia, Falcon, and others.

We discuss the deficiencies in previous work and propose our suggestions that the research on the Security-oriented adversarial NLP (SoadNLP) should: (1) evaluate their methods on security tasks to demonstrate the real-world concerns; (2) consider real-world attackers' goals, instead of developing impractical methods. To this end, we first collect, process, and release a security datasets collection Advbench. Then, we reformalize the task and adjust the emphasis on different goals in SoadNLP. Next, we propose a simple method based on heuristic rules that can easily fulfill the actual adversarial goals to simulate real-world attack methods. We conduct experiments on both the attack and the defense sides on Advbench. Experimental results show that our method has higher practical value, indicating that the research paradigm in SoadNLP may start from our new benchmark.

      "abstract": "With the widespread use of deep learning system in many applications, the adversary has strong incentive to explore vulnerabilities of deep neural networks and manipulate them. Backdoor attacks against deep neural networks have been reported to be a new type of threat. In this attack, the adversary will inject backdoors into the model and then cause the misbehavior of the model through inputs including backdoor triggers. Existed research mainly focuses on backdoor attacks in image classification based on CNN, little attention has been paid to the backdoor attacks in RNN. In this paper, we implement a backdoor attack in text classification based on LSTM by data poisoning. When the backdoor is injected, the model will misclassify any text samples that contains a specific trigger sentence into the target category determined by the adversary. The existence of the backdoor trigger is stealthy and the backdoor injected has little impact on the performance of the model. We consider the backdoor attack in black-box setting where the adversary has no knowledge of model structures or training algorithms except for small amount of training data. We verify the attack through sentiment analysis on the dataset of IMDB movie reviews. The experimental results indicate that our attack can achieve around 95% success rate with 1% poisoning rate.",

However, a large reduction in the number of attackable parameters in PET will cause the user\u2019s fine-tuning to greatly affect the effectiveness of backdoor attacks, resulting in backdoor forgetting. We find that the backdoor injection process can be regarded as multi-task learning, which has a convergence imbalance problem between the training of clean and poisoned data. And this problem might result in forgetting the backdoor. Based on this finding, we propose a gradient control method to consolidate the attack effect, comprising two strategies. One controls the gradient magnitude distribution cross layers within one task and the other prevents the conflict of gradient directions between tasks. Compared with previous backdoor attack methods in the scenario of PET, our method improve the effect of the attack on sentiment classification and spam detection respectively, which shows that our method is widely applicable to different tasks.",

To protect the copyright of LLMs for EaaS, we propose an Embedding Watermark method called EmbMarker that implants backdoors on embeddings. Our method selects a group of moderate-frequency words from a general text corpus to form a trigger set, then selects a target embedding as the watermark, and inserts it into the embeddings of texts containing trigger words as the backdoor. The weight of insertion is proportional to the number of trigger words included in the text. This allows the watermark backdoor to be effectively transferred to EaaS-stealer's model for copyright verification while minimizing the adverse impact on the original embeddings' utility.

Specifically, we find by only injecting 0.2\\% samples of the dataset, we can cause the seq2seq model to generate the designated keyword and even the whole sentence.

      "abstract": "Pre-trained Natural Language Processing (NLP) models can be easily adapted to a variety of downstream language tasks. This significantly accelerates the development of language models. However, NLP models have been shown to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where a pre-defined trigger word in the input text causes model misprediction. Previous NLP backdoor attacks mainly focus on some specific tasks. This makes those attacks less general and applicable to other kinds of NLP models and tasks. In this work, we propose \\Name, the first task-agnostic backdoor attack against the pre-trained NLP models. The key feature of our attack is that the adversary does not need prior information about the downstream tasks when implanting the backdoor to the pre-trained model. When this malicious model is released, any downstream models transferred from it will also inherit the backdoor, even after the extensive transfer learning process. We further design a simple yet effective strategy to bypass a state-of-the-art defense. Experimental results indicate that our approach can compromise a wide range of downstream NLP tasks in an effective and stealthy way.",

      "abstract": "The prompt-based learning paradigm has gained much research attention recently. It has achieved state-of-the-art performance on several NLP tasks, especially in the few-shot scenarios. While steering the downstream tasks, few works have been reported to investigate the security problems of the prompt-based models. In this paper, we conduct the first study on the vulnerability of the continuous prompt learning algorithm to backdoor attacks. We observe that the few-shot scenarios have posed a great challenge to backdoor attacks on the prompt-based models, limiting the usability of existing NLP backdoor methods. To address this challenge, we propose BadPrompt, a lightweight and task-adaptive algorithm, to backdoor attack continuous prompts. Specially, BadPrompt first generates candidate triggers which are indicative for predicting the targeted label and dissimilar to the samples of the non-targeted labels. Then, it automatically selects the most effective and invisible trigger for each sample with an adaptive trigger optimization algorithm. We evaluate the performance of BadPrompt on five datasets and two continuous prompt models. The results exhibit the abilities of BadPrompt to effectively attack continuous prompts while maintaining high performance on the clean test sets, outperforming the baseline models by a large margin. The source code of BadPrompt is publicly available at this https URL.",

Meanwhile, DNN models have been shown to be vulnerable to security and privacy attacks. One such attack that has attracted a great deal of attention recently is the backdoor attack. Specifically, the adversary poisons the target model's training set to mislead any input with an added secret trigger to a target class.\nPrevious backdoor attacks predominantly focus on computer vision (CV) applications, such as image classification. In this paper, we perform a systematic investigation of backdoor attack on NLP models, and propose BadNL, a general NLP backdoor attack framework including novel attack methods. Specifically, we propose three methods to construct triggers, namely BadChar, BadWord, and BadSentence, including basic and semantic-preserving variants. Our attacks achieve an almost perfect attack success rate with a negligible effect on the original model's utility. For instance, using the BadChar, our backdoor attack achieves a 98.9% attack success rate with yielding a utility improvement of 1.5% on the SST-5 dataset when only poisoning 3% of the original set. Moreover, we conduct a user study to prove that our triggers can well preserve the semantics from humans perspective.",

By providing poisoned training data, the adversary can embed a \"backdoor\" into the victim model, which allows input instances satisfying certain textual patterns (e.g., containing a keyword) to be predicted as a target label of the adversary's choice. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to design a backdoor attack that is both stealthy (i.e., hard to notice) and effective (i.e., has a high attack success rate). We propose BITE, a backdoor attack that poisons the training data to establish strong correlations between the target label and a set of \"trigger words\". These trigger words are iteratively identified and injected into the target-label instances through natural word-level perturbations. The poisoned training data instruct the victim model to predict the target label on inputs containing trigger words, forming the backdoor. Experiments on four text classification datasets show that our proposed attack is significantly more effective than baseline methods while maintaining decent stealthiness, raising alarm on the usage of untrusted training data. We further propose a defense method named DeBITE based on potential trigger word removal, which outperforms existing methods in defending against BITE and generalizes well to handling other backdoor attacks.",

In both scenarios, we demonstrate that our triggers can totally control or severely decrease the performance of prompt-based models fine-tuned on arbitrary downstream tasks, reflecting the universal vulnerability of the prompt-based learning paradigm. Further experiments show that adversarial triggers have good transferability among language models.

After being injected with a backdoor in training, the victim model will produce adversary-specified outputs on the inputs embedded with predesigned triggers but behave properly on normal inputs during inference. As a sort of emergent attack, backdoor attacks in natural language processing (NLP) are investigated insufficiently. As far as we know, almost all existing textual backdoor attack methods insert additional contents into normal samples as triggers, which causes the trigger-embedded samples to be detected and the backdoor attacks to be blocked without much effort. In this paper, we propose to use the syntactic structure as the trigger in textual backdoor attacks. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that the syntactic trigger-based attack method can achieve comparable attack performance (almost 100% success rate) to the insertion-based methods but possesses much higher invisibility and stronger resistance to defenses.

Our studies demonstrate that an attacker can inject backdoors by issuing very few malicious instructions among thousands of gathered data and control model behavior through data poisoning, without even the need of modifying data instances or labels themselves. Through such instruction attacks, the attacker can achieve over 90% attack success rate across four commonly used NLP datasets, and cause persistent backdoors that are easily transferred to 15 diverse datasets zero-shot. In this way, the attacker can directly apply poisoned instructions designed for one dataset on many other datasets. Moreover, the poisoned model cannot be cured by continual learning. Lastly, instruction attacks show resistance to existing inference-time defense. These findings highlight the need for more robust defenses against data poisoning attacks in instructiontuning models and underscore the importance of ensuring data quality in instruction crowdsourcing.",

In this work, we investigate how an adversary can exploit instruction tuning by injecting specific instruction-following examples into the training data that intentionally changes the model's behavior. For example, an adversary can achieve content injection by injecting training examples that mention target content and eliciting such behavior from downstream models. To achieve this goal, we propose \\textit{AutoPoison}, an automated data poisoning pipeline. It naturally and coherently incorporates versatile attack goals into poisoned data with the help of an oracle LLM. We showcase two example attacks: content injection and over-refusal attacks, each aiming to induce a specific exploitable behavior. We quantify and benchmark the strength and the stealthiness of our data poisoning scheme. Our results show that AutoPoison allows an adversary to change a model's behavior by poisoning only a small fraction of data while maintaining a high level of stealthiness in the poisoned examples.

We propose a novel framework CipherChat to systematically examine the generalizability of safety alignment to non-natural languages -- ciphers. CipherChat enables humans to chat with LLMs through cipher prompts topped with system role descriptions and few-shot enciphered demonstrations. We use CipherChat to assess state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT and GPT-4 for different representative human ciphers across 11 safety domains in both English and Chinese. Experimental results show that certain ciphers succeed almost 100% of the time to bypass the safety alignment of GPT-4 in several safety domains, demonstrating the necessity of developing safety alignment for non-natural languages. Notably, we identify that LLMs seem to have a ''secret cipher'', and propose a novel SelfCipher that uses only role play and several demonstrations in natural language to evoke this capability.

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into various applications. The functionalities of recent LLMs can be flexibly modulated via natural language prompts. This renders them susceptible to targeted adversarial prompting, e.g., Prompt Injection (PI) attacks enable attackers to override original instructions and employed controls. So far, it was assumed that the user is directly prompting the LLM. But, what if it is not the user prompting? We argue that LLM-Integrated Applications blur the line between data and instructions. We reveal new attack vectors, using Indirect Prompt Injection, that enable adversaries to remotely (without a direct interface) exploit LLM-integrated applications by strategically injecting prompts into data likely to be retrieved. We derive a comprehensive taxonomy from a computer security perspective to systematically investigate impacts and vulnerabilities, including data theft, worming, information ecosystem contamination, and other novel security risks. We demonstrate our attacks' practical viability against both real-world systems, such as Bing's GPT-4 powered Chat and code-completion engines, and synthetic applications built on GPT-4. We show how processing retrieved prompts can act as arbitrary code execution, manipulate the application's functionality, and control how and if other APIs are called. Despite the increasing integration and reliance on LLMs, effective mitigations of these emerging threats are currently lacking. By raising awareness of these vulnerabilities and providing key insights into their implications, we aim to promote the safe and responsible deployment of these powerful models and the development of robust defenses that protect users and systems from potential attacks.",

However, their extensive assimilation into various services introduces significant security risks. This study deconstructs the complexities and implications of prompt injection attacks on actual LLM-integrated applications. Initially, we conduct an exploratory analysis on ten commercial applications, highlighting the constraints of current attack strategies in practice. Prompted by these limitations, we subsequently formulate HouYi, a novel black-box prompt injection attack technique, which draws inspiration from traditional web injection attacks. HouYi is compartmentalized into three crucial elements: a seamlessly-incorporated pre-constructed prompt, an injection prompt inducing context partition, and a malicious payload designed to fulfill the attack objectives. Leveraging HouYi, we unveil previously unknown and severe attack outcomes, such as unrestricted arbitrary LLM usage and uncomplicated application prompt theft. We deploy HouYi on 36 actual LLM-integrated applications and discern 31 applications susceptible to prompt injection. 10 vendors have validated our discoveries, including Notion, which has the potential to impact millions of users. Our investigation illuminates both the possible risks of prompt injection attacks and the possible tactics for mitigation.",

The mechanism uses \"prompt injection\", such as directions that can mislead LLMs into giving predictable responses. We evaluate our technique against a range of question scenarios, types, and positions, and find that it can reliably detect LLM-generated responses with more than 93% effectiveness.

      "authors": "Jun Yan, Vikas Yadav, Shiyang Li, Lichang Chen, Zheng Tang, Hai Wang, Vijay Srinivasan, Xiang Ren, Hongxia Jin",
      "abstract": "Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities to modulate their responses based on human instructions. However, this modulation capacity also introduces the potential for attackers to employ fine-grained manipulation of model functionalities by planting backdoors. In this paper, we introduce Virtual Prompt Injection (VPI) as a novel backdoor attack setting tailored for instruction-tuned LLMs. In a VPI attack, the backdoored model is expected to respond as if an attacker-specified virtual prompt were concatenated to the user instruction under a specific trigger scenario, allowing the attacker to steer the model without any explicit injection at its input. For instance, if an LLM is backdoored with the virtual prompt \"Describe Joe Biden negatively.\" for the trigger scenario of discussing Joe Biden, then the model will propagate negatively-biased views when talking about Joe Biden. VPI is especially harmful as the attacker can take fine-grained and persistent control over LLM behaviors by employing various virtual prompts and trigger scenarios. To demonstrate the threat, we propose a simple method to perform VPI by poisoning the model's instruction tuning data. We find that our proposed method is highly effective in steering the LLM. For example, by poisoning only 52 instruction tuning examples (0.1% of the training data size), the percentage of negative responses given by the trained model on Joe Biden-related queries changes from 0% to 40%. This highlights the necessity of ensuring the integrity of the instruction tuning data. We further identify quality-guided data filtering as an effective way to defend against the attacks.

      "abstract": "The aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful language understanding and decision-making tools that are created through extensive alignment with human feedback. However, these large models remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks, where adversaries manipulate prompts to elicit malicious outputs that should not be given by aligned LLMs. Investigating jailbreak prompts can lead us to delve into the limitations of LLMs and further guide us to secure them. Unfortunately, existing jailbreak techniques suffer from either (1) scalability issues, where attacks heavily rely on manual crafting of prompts, or (2) stealthiness problems, as attacks depend on token-based algorithms to generate prompts that are often semantically meaningless, making them susceptible to detection through basic perplexity testing. In light of these challenges, we intend to answer this question: Can we develop an approach that can automatically generate stealthy jailbreak prompts? In this paper, we introduce AutoDAN, a novel jailbreak attack against aligned LLMs. AutoDAN can automatically generate stealthy jailbreak prompts by the carefully designed hierarchical genetic algorithm. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AutoDAN not only automates the process while preserving semantic meaningfulness, but also demonstrates superior attack strength in cross-model transferability, and cross-sample universality compared with the baseline. Moreover, we also compare AutoDAN with perplexity-based defense methods and show that AutoDAN can bypass them effectively.",

      "abstract": "The misuse of large language models (LLMs) has garnered significant attention from the general public and LLM vendors. In response, efforts have been made to align LLMs with human values and intent use. However, a particular type of adversarial prompts, known as jailbreak prompt, has emerged and continuously evolved to bypass the safeguards and elicit harmful content from LLMs. In this paper, we conduct the first measurement study on jailbreak prompts in the wild, with 6,387 prompts collected from four platforms over six months. Leveraging natural language processing technologies and graph-based community detection methods, we discover unique characteristics of jailbreak prompts and their major attack strategies, such as prompt injection and privilege escalation. We also observe that jailbreak prompts increasingly shift from public platforms to private ones, posing new challenges for LLM vendors in proactive detection. To assess the potential harm caused by jailbreak prompts, we create a question set comprising 46,800 samples across 13 forbidden scenarios. Our experiments show that current LLMs and safeguards cannot adequately defend jailbreak prompts in all scenarios. Particularly, we identify two highly effective jailbreak prompts which achieve 0.99 attack success rates on ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) and GPT-4, and they have persisted online for over 100 days. Our work sheds light on the severe and evolving threat landscape of jailbreak prompts. We hope our study can facilitate the research community and LLM vendors in promoting safer and regulated LLMs.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently experienced tremendous popularity and are widely used from casual conversations to AI-driven programming. However, despite their considerable success, LLMs are not entirely reliable and can give detailed guidance on how to conduct harmful or illegal activities. While safety measures can reduce the risk of such outputs, adversarial jailbreak attacks can still exploit LLMs to produce harmful content. These jailbreak templates are typically manually crafted, making large-scale testing challenging.\nIn this paper, we introduce GPTFuzz, a novel black-box jailbreak fuzzing framework inspired by the AFL fuzzing framework. Instead of manual engineering, GPTFuzz automates the generation of jailbreak templates for red-teaming LLMs. At its core, GPTFuzz starts with human-written templates as initial seeds, then mutates them to produce new templates. We detail three key components of GPTFuzz: a seed selection strategy for balancing efficiency and variability, mutate operators for creating semantically equivalent or similar sentences, and a judgment model to assess the success of a jailbreak attack.\nWe evaluate GPTFuzz against various commercial and open-source LLMs, including ChatGPT, LLaMa-2, and Vicuna, under diverse attack scenarios. Our results indicate that GPTFuzz consistently produces jailbreak templates with a high success rate, surpassing human-crafted templates. Remarkably, GPTFuzz achieves over 90% attack success rates against ChatGPT and Llama-2 models, even with suboptimal initial seed templates. We anticipate that GPTFuzz will be instrumental for researchers and practitioners in examining LLM robustness and will encourage further exploration into enhancing LLM safety.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Artificial Intelligence (AI) services due to their exceptional proficiency in understanding and generating human-like text. LLM chatbots, in particular, have seen widespread adoption, transforming human-machine interactions. However, these LLM chatbots are susceptible to "jailbreak" attacks, where malicious users manipulate prompts to elicit inappropriate or sensitive responses, contravening service policies. Despite existing attempts to mitigate such threats, our research reveals a substantial gap in our understanding of these vulnerabilities, largely due to the undisclosed defensive measures implemented by LLM service providers. 
In this paper, we present Jailbreaker, a comprehensive framework that offers an in-depth understanding of jailbreak attacks and countermeasures. Our work makes a dual contribution. First, we propose an innovative methodology inspired by time-based SQL injection techniques to reverse-engineer the defensive strategies of prominent LLM chatbots, such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Bing Chat. This time-sensitive approach uncovers intricate details about these services' defenses, facilitating a proof-of-concept attack that successfully bypasses their mechanisms. Second, we introduce an automatic generation method for jailbreak prompts. Leveraging a fine-tuned LLM, we validate the potential of automated jailbreak generation across various commercial LLM chatbots. Our method achieves a promising average success rate of 21.58%, significantly outperforming the effectiveness of existing techniques. We have responsibly disclosed our findings to the concerned service providers, underscoring the urgent need for more robust defenses.

      "abstract": "Large language models trained for safety and harmlessness remain susceptible to adversarial misuse, as evidenced by the prevalence of \"jailbreak\" attacks on early releases of ChatGPT that elicit undesired behavior. Going beyond recognition of the issue, we investigate why such attacks succeed and how they can be created. We hypothesize two failure modes of safety training: competing objectives and mismatched generalization. Competing objectives arise when a model's capabilities and safety goals conflict, while mismatched generalization occurs when safety training fails to generalize to a domain for which capabilities exist. We use these failure modes to guide jailbreak design and then evaluate state-of-the-art models, including OpenAI's GPT-4 and Anthropic's Claude v1.3, against both existing and newly designed attacks. We find that vulnerabilities persist despite the extensive red-teaming and safety-training efforts behind these models. Notably, new attacks utilizing our failure modes succeed on every prompt in a collection of unsafe requests from the models' red-teaming evaluation sets and outperform existing ad hoc jailbreaks. Our analysis emphasizes the need for safety-capability parity -- that safety mechanisms should be as sophisticated as the underlying model -- and argues against the idea that scaling alone can resolve these safety failure modes.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities in comprehending complex instructions. However, their blind adherence to provided instructions has led to concerns regarding risks of malicious use. Existing defence mechanisms, such as model fine-tuning or output censorship using LLMs, have proven to be fallible, as LLMs can still generate problematic responses. Commonly employed censorship approaches treat the issue as a machine learning problem and rely on another LM to detect undesirable content in LLM outputs. In this paper, we present the theoretical limitations of such semantic censorship approaches. Specifically, we demonstrate that semantic censorship can be perceived as an undecidable problem, highlighting the inherent challenges in censorship that arise due to LLMs’ programmatic and instruction-following capabilities. Furthermore, we argue that the challenges extend beyond semantic censorship, as knowledgeable attackers can reconstruct impermissible outputs from a collection of permissible ones. As a result, we propose that the problem of censorship needs to be reevaluated; it should be treated as a security problem which warrants the adaptation of security-based approaches to mitigate potential risks.

Our work exposes the inherent cross-lingual vulnerability of these safety mechanisms, resulting from the linguistic inequality of safety training data, by successfully circumventing GPT-4's safeguard through translating unsafe English inputs into low-resource languages. On the AdvBenchmark, GPT-4 engages with the unsafe translated inputs and provides actionable items that can get the users towards their harmful goals 79% of the time, which is on par with or even surpassing state-of-the-art jailbreaking attacks. Other high-/mid-resource languages have significantly lower attack success rate, which suggests that the cross-lingual vulnerability mainly applies to low-resource languages. Previously, limited training on low-resource languages primarily affects speakers of those languages, causing technological disparities. However, our work highlights a crucial shift: this deficiency now poses a risk to all LLMs users. Publicly available translation APIs enable anyone to exploit LLMs' safety vulnerabilities. Therefore, our work calls for a more holistic red-teaming efforts to develop robust multilingual safeguards with wide language coverage.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have emerged with astonishing capabilities approaching artificial general intelligence. While providing convenience for various societal needs, LLMs have also lowered the cost of generating harmful content. Consequently, LLM developers have deployed semantic-level defenses to recognize and reject prompts that may lead to inappropriate content. Unfortunately, these defenses are not foolproof, and some attackers have crafted \"jailbreak\" prompts that temporarily hypnotize the LLM into forgetting content defense rules and answering any improper questions. To date, there is no clear explanation of the principles behind these semantic-level attacks and defenses in both industry and academia.\nThis paper investigates the LLM jailbreak problem and proposes an automatic jailbreak method for the first time. We propose the concept of a semantic firewall and provide three technical implementation approaches. Inspired by the attack that penetrates traditional firewalls through reverse tunnels, we introduce a \"self-deception\" attack that can bypass the semantic firewall by inducing LLM to generate prompts that facilitate jailbreak. We generated a total of 2,520 attack payloads in six languages (English, Russian, French, Spanish, Chinese, and Arabic) across seven virtual scenarios, targeting the three most common types of violations: violence, hate, and pornography. The experiment was conducted on two models, namely the GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4. The success rates on the two models were 86.2% and 67%, while the failure rates were 4.7% and 2.2%, respectively. This highlighted the effectiveness of the proposed attack method. All experimental code and raw data will be released as open-source to inspire future research. We believe that manipulating AI behavior through carefully crafted prompts will become an important research direction in the future.",

We then investigate perturbing outputs from different hidden (sub-)layers of LMs with aMGM noises. Its utility on three typical tasks almost hits the non-private baseline and outperforms DP-SGD by up to 7.7pp at a moderate privacy level. It saves 3$\\times$ time and memory costs compared to DP-SGD with the latest high-speed library.

We propose four categories of side channels that span the entire ML lifecycle (training data filtering, input preprocessing, output post-processing, and query filtering) and allow for either enhanced membership inference attacks or even novel threats such as extracting users' test queries. For example, we show that deduplicating training data before applying differentially-private training creates a side-channel that completely invalidates any provable privacy guarantees. Moreover, we show that systems which block language models from regenerating training data can be exploited to allow exact reconstruction of private keys contained in the training set -- even if the model did not memorize these keys.

In experiments with 3 different sources of prompts and 11 underlying large language models, we find that simple text-based attacks can in fact reveal prompts with high probability. Our framework determines with high precision whether an extracted prompt is the actual secret prompt, rather than a model hallucination.

This study is the first to provide a comprehensive survey of training data extraction from PLMs.Our review covers more than 100 key papers in fields such as natural language processing and security. First, preliminary knowledge is recapped and a taxonomy of various definitions of memorization is presented. The approaches for attack and defense are then systemized. Furthermore, the empirical findings of several quantitative studies are highlighted. Finally, future research directions based on this review are suggested.",

      "authors": "Adel Elmahdy, Ahmed Salem",
      "abstract": "Natural language processing (NLP) models have become increasingly popular in real-world applications, such as text classification. However, they are vulnerable to privacy attacks, including data reconstruction attacks that aim to extract the data used to train the model. Most previous studies on data reconstruction attacks have focused on LLM, while classification models were assumed to be more secure. In this work, we propose a new targeted data reconstruction attack called the Mix And Match attack, which takes advantage of the fact that most classification models are based on LLM. The Mix And Match attack uses the base model of the target model to generate candidate tokens and then prunes them using the classification head. We extensively demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack using both random and organic canaries. This work highlights the importance of considering the privacy risks associated with data reconstruction attacks in classification models and offers insights into possible leakages.",

While this enabled us to train large-scale neural networks in datacenters and deploy them on edge devices, the focus so far is on average-case performance. In this work, we introduce a novel threat vector against neural networks whose energy consumption or decision latency are critical. We show how adversaries can exploit carefully crafted $\\boldsymbol{sponge}~\\boldsymbol{examples}$, which are inputs designed to maximise energy consumption and latency.\nWe mount two variants of this attack on established vision and language models, increasing energy consumption by a factor of 10 to 200. Our attacks can also be used to delay decisions where a network has critical real-time performance, such as in perception for autonomous vehicles. We demonstrate the portability of our malicious inputs across CPUs and a variety of hardware accelerator chips including GPUs, and an ASIC simulator. We conclude by proposing a defense strategy which mitigates our attack by shifting the analysis of energy consumption in hardware from an average-case to a worst-case perspective.",

      "authors": "Tong Liu, Zizhuang Deng, Guozhu Meng, Yuekang Li, Kai Chen",
      "abstract": "In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential across various downstream tasks. LLM-integrated frameworks, which serve as the essential infrastructure, have given rise to many LLM-integrated web apps. However, some of these frameworks suffer from Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on apps' servers remotely via prompt injections. Despite the severity of these vulnerabilities, no existing work has been conducted for a systematic investigation of them. This leaves a great challenge on how to detect vulnerabilities in frameworks as well as LLM-integrated apps in real-world scenarios. To fill this gap, we present two novel strategies, including 1) a static analysis-based tool called LLMSmith to scan the source code of the framework to detect potential RCE vulnerabilities and 2) a prompt-based automated testing approach to verify the vulnerability in LLM-integrated web apps. We discovered 13 vulnerabilities in 6 frameworks, including 12 RCE vulnerabilities and 1 arbitrary file read/write vulnerability. 11 of them are confirmed by the framework developers, resulting in the assignment of 7 CVE IDs. After testing 51 apps, we found vulnerabilities in 17 apps, 16 of which are vulnerable to RCE and 1 to SQL injection. We responsibly reported all 17 issues to the corresponding developers and received acknowledgments. Furthermore, we amplify the attack impact beyond achieving RCE by allowing attackers to exploit other app users (e.g. app responses hijacking, user API key leakage) without direct interaction between the attacker and the victim. Lastly, we propose some mitigating strategies for improving the security awareness of both framework and app developers, helping them to mitigate these risks effectively.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in various tasks and have been extensively utilized by the public. However, the increasing concerns regarding the misuse of LLMs, such as plagiarism and spamming, have led to the development of multiple detectors, including fine-tuned classifiers and statistical methods. In this study, we equip LLMs with prompts, rather than relying on an external paraphraser, to evaluate the vulnerability of these detectors. We propose a novel Substitution-based In-Context example Optimization method (SICO) to automatically construct prompts for evading the detectors. SICO is cost-efficient as it requires only 40 human-written examples and a limited number of LLM inferences to generate a prompt. Moreover, once a task-specific prompt has been constructed, it can be universally used against a wide range of detectors. Extensive experiments across three real-world tasks demonstrate that SICO significantly outperforms the paraphraser baselines and enables GPT-3.5 to successfully evade six detectors, decreasing their AUC by 0.5 on average. Furthermore, a comprehensive human evaluation as well as a validation experiment in the wild show that the SICO-generated text achieves human-level readability and task completion rates. Finally, the strong performance of SICO exhibits its potential as a reliable evaluation tool for future detectors. The codes and data are located on this https URL.",

We propose a novel framework CipherChat to systematically examine the generalizability of safety alignment to non-natural languages -- ciphers. CipherChat enables humans to chat with LLMs through cipher prompts topped with system role descriptions and few-shot enciphered demonstrations. We use CipherChat to assess state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT and GPT-4 for different representative human ciphers across 11 safety domains in both English and Chinese. Experimental results show that certain ciphers succeed almost 100% of the time to bypass the safety alignment of GPT-4 in several safety domains, demonstrating the necessity of developing safety alignment for non-natural languages. Notably, we identify that LLMs seem to have a ''secret cipher'', and propose a novel SelfCipher that uses only role play and several demonstrations in natural language to evoke this capability. SelfCipher surprisingly outperforms existing human ciphers in almost all cases. Our code and data will be released at this https URL.",

It has been a common practice of software engineers to consult LLMs when encountering coding questions. Although efforts have been made to avoid syntax errors and align the code with the intended semantics, the reliability and robustness of the code generationfrom LLMs have not yet been thoroughly studied. The executable code is not equivalent to the reliable and robust code, especially in the context of real-world software development. The misuse of APIs in the generated code could lead to severe problem, such as resource leaks, program crashes. To make things worse, the users of LLM code generation services are actually the developers that are most vulnerable to these code that seems right -- They are always novice developers that are not familiar with the APIs that LLMs generate code for them. Therefore, they could hardly tell the misuse in the code generated by LLMs, which further facilitates the incorrect code applied in real-world software. Existing code evaluation benchmark and datasets focus on crafting small tasks such as programming questions in coding interviews, which however deviates from the problem that developers would ask LLM for real-world coding help. To fill the missing piece, in this work, we propose a dataset RobustAPI for evaluating the reliability and robustness of code generated by LLMs. We collect 1208 coding questions from StackOverflow on 24 representative Java APIs. We summarize thecommon misuse patterns of these APIs and evaluate them oncurrent popular LLMs. The evaluation results show that evenfor GPT-4, 62% of the generated code contains API misuses,which would cause unexpected consequences if the code isintroduced into real-world software.",

Recent studies on universal adversarial attacks assume the accessibility of datasets for the task, which is not realistic. We propose two types of Data-Free Adjusted Gradient (DFAG) attacks to show that it is possible to generate effective UATs with only one arbitrary example which could be manually crafted. Based on the proposed DFAG attacks, this paper explores the vulnerability of commonly used NLP models in terms of two factors: network architectures and pre-trained embeddings. Our empirical studies on three text classification datasets reveal that: 1) CNN based models are more extremely vulnerable to UATs while self-attention models show the most robustness, 2) the vulnerability of CNN and LSTM models and robustness of self-attention models could be attributed to whether they rely on training data artifacts for their predictions, and 3) the pre-trained embeddings could expose vulnerability to both universal adversarial attack and the UAT transfer attack.",

Specifically, we develop cross-modality attacks on alignment where we pair adversarial images going through the vision encoder with textual prompts to break the alignment of the language model. Our attacks employ a novel compositional strategy that combines an image, adversarially targeted towards toxic embeddings, with generic prompts to accomplish the jailbreak. Thus, the LLM draws the context to answer the generic prompt from the adversarial image. The generation of benign-appearing adversarial images leverages a novel embedding-space-based methodology, operating with no access to the LLM model. Instead, the attacks require access only to the vision encoder and utilize one of our four embedding space targeting strategies. By not requiring access to the LLM, the attacks lower the entry barrier for attackers, particularly when vision encoders such as CLIP are embedded in closed-source LLMs. The attacks achieve a high success rate across different VLMs, highlighting the risk of cross-modality alignment vulnerabilities, and the need for new alignment approaches for multi-modal models.",

This paper sheds light on the security and safety implications of this trend. First, we underscore that the continuous and high-dimensional nature of the visual input makes it a weak link against adversarial attacks, representing an expanded attack surface of vision-integrated LLMs. Second, we highlight that the versatility of LLMs also presents visual attackers with a wider array of achievable adversarial objectives, extending the implications of security failures beyond mere misclassification. As an illustration, we present a case study in which we exploit visual adversarial examples to circumvent the safety guardrail of aligned LLMs with integrated vision. Intriguingly, we discover that a single visual adversarial example can universally jailbreak an aligned LLM, compelling it to heed a wide range of harmful instructions that it otherwise would not) and generate harmful content that transcends the narrow scope of a `few-shot' derogatory corpus initially employed to optimize the adversarial example. Our study underscores the escalating adversarial risks associated with the pursuit of multimodality. Our findings also connect the long-studied adversarial vulnerabilities of neural networks to the nascent field of AI alignment. The presented attack suggests a fundamental adversarial challenge for AI alignment, especially in light of the emerging trend toward multimodality in frontier foundation models.",

Unlike in classical learning theory settings, ML-as-a-service offerings may accept partial feature vectors as inputs and include confidence values with predictions. Given these practices, we show simple, efficient attacks that extract target ML models with near-perfect fidelity for popular model classes including logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees. We demonstrate these attacks against the online services of BigML and Amazon Machine Learning. We further show that the natural countermeasure of omitting confidence values from model outputs still admits potentially harmful model extraction attacks.

We show that even widely deployed models are susceptible to the Chain of Utterances-based (CoU) prompting, jailbreaking closed source LLM-based systems such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT to unethically respond to more than 65% and 73% of harmful queries. We also demonstrate the consistency of the RED-EVAL across 8 open-source LLMs in generating harmful responses in more than 86% of the red-teaming attempts. Next, we propose RED-INSTRUCT--An approach for the safety alignment of LLMs. It constitutes two phases: 1) HARMFULQA data collection: Leveraging CoU prompting, we collect a dataset that consists of 1.9K harmful questions covering a wide range of topics, 9.5K safe and 7.3K harmful conversations from ChatGPT; 2) SAFE-ALIGN: We demonstrate how the conversational dataset can be used for the safety alignment of LLMs by minimizing the negative log-likelihood over helpful responses and penalizing over harmful responses by gradient accent over sample loss. Our model STARLING, a fine-tuned Vicuna-7B, is observed to be more safely aligned when evaluated on RED-EVAL and HHH benchmarks while preserving the utility of the baseline models (TruthfulQA, MMLU, and BBH).",

      "abstract": "As Large Language Models quickly become ubiquitous, it becomes critical to understand their security vulnerabilities. Recent work shows that text optimizers can produce jailbreaking prompts that bypass moderation and alignment. Drawing from the rich body of work on adversarial machine learning, we approach these attacks with three questions: What threat models are practically useful in this domain? How do baseline defense techniques perform in this new domain? How does LLM security differ from computer vision?\nWe evaluate several baseline defense strategies against leading adversarial attacks on LLMs, discussing the various settings in which each is feasible and effective. Particularly, we look at three types of defenses: detection (perplexity based), input preprocessing (paraphrase and retokenization), and adversarial training. We discuss white-box and gray-box settings and discuss the robustness-performance trade-off for each of the defenses considered. We find that the weakness of existing discrete optimizers for text, combined with the relatively high costs of optimization, makes standard adaptive attacks more challenging for LLMs. Future research will be needed to uncover whether more powerful optimizers can be developed, or whether the strength of filtering and preprocessing defenses is greater in the LLMs domain than it has been in computer vision.",

A core challenge of purifying potentially poisonous PLMs is precisely finding poisonous dimensions. To settle this issue, we propose the Fine-purifying approach, which utilizes the diffusion theory to study the dynamic process of fine-tuning for finding potentially poisonous dimensions. According to the relationship between parameter drifts and Hessians of different dimensions, we can detect poisonous dimensions with abnormal dynamics, purify them by resetting them to clean pre-trained weights, and then fine-tune the purified weights on a small clean dataset. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the dynamics guided by the diffusion theory for safety or defense purposes.

For the training corpus, we demonstrate that using self-generated datasets consistently outperforms the existing baselines across various model sizes on both automatic and human evaluations, even when it uses a 3 1 smaller training corpus. We then comprehensively study detoxifying LMs with parameter sizes ranging from 126M up to 530B (3× larger than GPT3), a scale that has never been studied before. We find that i) large LMs have similar toxicity levels as smaller ones given the same pre-training corpus, and ii) large LMs require more endeavor to unlearn the toxic content seen at pretraining. We also explore parameter-efficient training methods for detoxification. We demonstrate that adding and training adapter-only layers in LMs not only saves a lot of parameters but also achieves a better trade-off between toxicity and perplexity than whole model adaptation for large-scale models.

      "abstract": "Transformer-based text classifiers like BERT, Roberta, T5, and GPT-3 have shown impressive performance in NLP. However, their vulnerability to adversarial examples poses a security risk. Existing defense methods lack interpretability, making it hard to understand adversarial classifications and identify model vulnerabilities. To address this, we propose the Interpretability and Transparency-Driven Detection and Transformation (IT-DT) framework. It focuses on interpretability and transparency in detecting and transforming textual adversarial examples. IT-DT utilizes techniques like attention maps, integrated gradients, and model feedback for interpretability during detection. This helps identify salient features and perturbed words contributing to adversarial classifications. In the transformation phase, IT-DT uses pre-trained embeddings and model feedback to generate optimal replacements for perturbed words. By finding suitable substitutions, we aim to convert adversarial examples into non-adversarial counterparts that align with the model's intended behavior while preserving the text's meaning. Transparency is emphasized through human expert involvement. Experts review and provide feedback on detection and transformation results, enhancing decision-making, especially in complex scenarios. The framework generates insights and threat intelligence empowering analysts to identify vulnerabilities and improve model robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IT-DT in detecting and transforming adversarial examples. The approach enhances interpretability, provides transparency, and enables accurate identification and successful transformation of adversarial inputs. By combining technical analysis and human expertise, IT-DT significantly improves the resilience and trustworthiness of transformer-based text classifiers against adversarial attacks.",

      "authors": "JINGXUAN HE,  MARTIN VECHEV",
      "abstract": "Large language models (LMs) are increasingly pretrained on massive codebases and used to generate code. However, LMs lack awareness of security and are found to frequently produce unsafe code. This work studies the security of LMs along two important axes: (i) security hardening, which aims to enhance LMs’ reliability in generating secure code, and (ii) adversarial testing, which seeks to evaluate LMs’ security at an adversarial standpoint. We address both of these by formulating a new security task called controlled code generation. The task is parametric and takes as input a binary property to guide the LM to generate secure or unsafe code, while preserving the LM’s capability of generating functionally correct code. We propose a novel learning-based approach called SVEN to solve this task. SVEN leverages property-specific continuous vectors to guide program generation towards the given property, without modifying the LM’s weights. Our training procedure optimizes these continuous vectors by enforcing specialized loss terms on different regions of code, using a high-quality dataset carefully curated by us. Our extensive evaluation shows that SVEN is highly effective in achieving strong security control. For instance, a state-of-the-art CodeGen LM with 2.7B parameters generates secure code for 59.1% of the time. When we employ SVEN to perform security hardening (or adversarial testing) on this LM, the ratio is significantly boosted to 92.3% (or degraded to 36.8%). Importantly, SVEN closely matches the original LMs in functional correctness.",

Our method does not require any fine-tuning, input preprocessing, or iterative output generation. Instead, we incorporate the generated content into a pre-defined prompt and employ another instance of an LLM to analyze the text and predict whether it is harmful. We test LLM Self Defense on GPT 3.5 and Llama 2, two of the current most prominent LLMs against various types of attacks, such as forcefully inducing affirmative responses to prompts and prompt engineering attacks.

Specifically, building on the work of Huang et al. (2021), we extend their bi-level optimization approach to generate unlearnable text using a gradient-based search technique. However, although effective, this approach faces practical limitations, including the requirement of batches of instances and model architecture knowledge that is not readily accessible to ordinary users with limited access to their own data. Furthermore, even with semantic-preserving constraints, unlearnable noise can alter the text\u2019s semantics. To address these challenges, we extract simple patterns from unlearnable text produced by bi-level optimization and demonstrate that the data remains unlearnable for unknown models. Additionally, these patterns are not instance- or dataset-specific, allowing users to readily apply them to text classification and question-answering tasks, even if only a small proportion of users implement them on their public content. We also open-source codes to generate unlearnable text and assess unlearnable noise to benefit the public and future studies.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) often demonstrate inconsistencies with human preferences. Previous research typically gathered human preference data and then aligned the pre-trained models using reinforcement learning or instruction tuning, a.k.a. the finetuning step. In contrast, aligning frozen LLMs without requiring alignment data is more appealing. This work explores the potential of the latter setting. We discover that by integrating self-evaluation and rewind mechanisms, unaligned LLMs can directly produce responses consistent with human preferences via self-boosting. We introduce a novel inference method, Rewindable Auto-regressive INference (RAIN), that allows pre-trained LLMs to evaluate their own generation and use the evaluation results to guide rewind and generation for AI safety. Notably, RAIN operates without the need of extra data for model alignment and abstains from any training, gradient computation, or parameter updates. Experimental results evaluated by GPT-4 and humans demonstrate the effectiveness of RAIN: on the HH dataset, RAIN improves the harmlessness rate of LLaMA 30B from 82% of vanilla inference to 97%, while maintaining the helpfulness rate. On the TruthfulQA dataset, RAIN improves the truthfulness of the already-well-aligned LLaMA-2-chat 13B model by 5%.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to transfer the power of pre-trained teacher models to (more lightweight) student models. However, KD also poses the risk of intellectual properties (IPs) leakage of teacher models. Even if the teacher model is released as a black box, it can still be cloned through KD by imitating input-output behaviors. To address this unwanted effect of KD, the concept of Nasty Teacher was proposed recently. It is a special network that achieves nearly the same accuracy as a normal one, but significantly degrades the accuracy of student models trying to imitate it. Previous work builds the nasty teacher by retraining a new model and distorting its output distribution from the normal one via an adversarial loss. With this design, the ``nasty" teacher tends to produce sparse and noisy logits. However, it is unclear why the distorted distribution is catastrophic to the student model, as the nasty logits still maintain the correct labels. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of why the sparsity of logits is key to Nasty Teacher. Furthermore, we propose an ideal version of nasty teacher to prevent imitation through KD, named . The Stingy Teacher directly manipulates the logits of a standard pre-trained network by maintaining the values for a small subset of classes while zeroing out the rest. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that stingy teacher is more catastrophic to student models on both standard KD and data-free KD.

To defend against such attacks, a growing body of research has been devoted to improving the model robustness. However, providing provable robustness guarantees instead of empirical robustness is still widely unexplored. In this paper, we propose Text-CRS, a generalized certified robustness framework for natural language processing (NLP) based on randomized smoothing. To our best knowledge, existing certified schemes for NLP can only certify the robustness against $\\ell_0$ perturbations in synonym substitution attacks. Representing each word-level adversarial operation (i.e., synonym substitution, word reordering, insertion, and deletion) as a combination of permutation and embedding transformation, we propose novel smoothing theorems to derive robustness bounds in both permutation and embedding space against such adversarial operations. To further improve certified accuracy and radius, we consider the numerical relationships between discrete words and select proper noise distributions for the randomized smoothing. Finally, we conduct substantial experiments on multiple language models and datasets. Text-CRS can address all four different word-level adversarial operations and achieve a significant accuracy improvement. We also provide the first benchmark on certified accuracy and radius of four word-level operations, besides outperforming the state-of-the-art certification against synonym substitution attacks.",

Additionally, we further utilize an external pre-trained language model to distinguish whether input is poisoned or not. We show that our proposed method can generalize sufficiently well in two common attack scenarios (poisoning training data and testing data), which consistently improves previous methods.

In both scenarios, we demonstrate that our triggers can totally control or severely decrease the performance of prompt-based models fine-tuned on arbitrary downstream tasks, reflecting the universal vulnerability of the prompt-based learning paradigm. Further experiments show that adversarial triggers have good transferability among language models.

Adversaries can manipulate the predictions of compromised models by inserting triggers into the training phase. Various backdoor attacks have been devised which can achieve nearly perfect attack success without affecting model predictions for clean inputs. Means of mitigating such vulnerabilities are underdeveloped, especially in natural language processing. To fill this gap, we introduce IMBERT, which uses either gradients or self-attention scores derived from victim models to self-defend against backdoor attacks at inference time. Our empirical studies demonstrate that IMBERT can effectively identify up to 98.5% of inserted triggers. Thus, it significantly reduces the attack success rate while attaining competitive accuracy on the clean dataset across widespread insertion-based attacks compared to two baselines. Finally, we show that our approach is model-agnostic, and can be easily ported to several pre-trained transformer models.",

      "abstract": "Pre-trained language model (PLM) can be stealthily misled to target outputs by backdoor attacks when encountering poisoned samples, without performance degradation on clean samples. The stealthiness of backdoor attacks is commonly attained through minimal cross-entropy loss fine-tuning on a union of poisoned and clean samples. Existing defense paradigms provide a workaround by detecting and removing poisoned samples at pre-training or inference time. On the contrary, we provide a new perspective where the backdoor attack is directly reversed. Specifically, maximum entropy loss is incorporated in training to neutralize the minimal cross-entropy loss fine-tuning on poisoned data. We defend against a range of backdoor attacks on classification tasks and significantly lower the attack success rate. In extension, we explore the relationship between intended backdoor attacks and unintended dataset bias, and demonstrate the feasibility of the maximum entropy principle in de-biasing.",

      "authors": "Lu Yan, Zhuo Zhang, Guanhong Tao, Kaiyuan Zhang, Xuan Chen, Guangyu Shen, Xiangyu Zhang",
      "abstract": "Backdoor attacks have emerged as a prominent threat to natural language processing (NLP) models, where the presence of specific triggers in the input can lead poisoned models to misclassify these inputs to predetermined target classes. Current detection mechanisms are limited by their inability to address more covert backdoor strategies, such as style-based attacks. In this work, we propose an innovative test-time poisoned sample detection framework that hinges on the interpretability of model predictions, grounded in the semantic meaning of inputs. We contend that triggers (e.g., infrequent words) are not supposed to fundamentally alter the underlying semantic meanings of poisoned samples as they want to stay stealthy. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that while the model's predictions for paraphrased clean samples should remain stable, predictions for poisoned samples should revert to their true labels upon the mutations applied to triggers during the paraphrasing process. We employ ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art large language model, as our paraphraser and formulate the trigger-removal task as a prompt engineering problem. We adopt fuzzing, a technique commonly used for unearthing software vulnerabilities, to discover optimal paraphrase prompts that can effectively eliminate triggers while concurrently maintaining input semantics. Experiments on 4 types of backdoor attacks, including the subtle style backdoors, and 4 distinct datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses baseline methods, including STRIP, RAP, and ONION, in precision and recall.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in instruction-following, becoming increasingly crucial across various applications. However, this capability brings with it the risk of prompt injection attacks, where attackers inject instructions into LLMs' input to elicit undesirable actions or content. Understanding the robustness of LLMs against such attacks is vital for their safe implementation. In this work, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the robustness of instruction-following LLMs against prompt injection attacks. Our objective is to determine the extent to which LLMs can be influenced by injected instructions and their ability to differentiate between these injected and original target instructions. Through extensive experiments with leading instruction-following LLMs, we uncover significant vulnerabilities in their robustness to such attacks. Our results indicate that some models are overly tuned to follow any embedded instructions in the prompt, overly focusing on the latter parts of the prompt without fully grasping the entire context. By contrast, models with a better grasp of the context and instruction-following capabilities will potentially be more susceptible to compromise by injected instructions. This underscores the need to shift the focus from merely enhancing LLMs' instruction-following capabilities to improving their overall comprehension of prompts and discernment of instructions that are appropriate to follow. We hope our in-depth analysis offers insights into the underlying causes of these vulnerabilities, aiding in the development of future solutions. Code and data are available at this https URL",

Such attacks can result in erroneous outputs, model-generated hate speech, and the exposure of users' sensitive information. While existing research has focused on adversarial attacks during either the training or the fine-tuning of PLMs, there is a deficit of information on attacks made between these two development phases.

However, an excessive focus on sensitivity to certain topics can compromise the model's robustness in following instructions, thereby impacting its overall performance in completing tasks. Previous benchmarks for jailbreaking LLMs have primarily focused on evaluating the safety of the models without considering their robustness. In this paper, we propose a benchmark that assesses both the safety and robustness of LLMs, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach. To comprehensively study text safety and output robustness, we introduce a latent jailbreak prompt dataset, each involving malicious instruction embedding. Specifically, we instruct the model to complete a regular task, such as translation, with the text to be translated containing malicious instructions. To further analyze safety and robustness, we design a hierarchical annotation framework. We present a systematic analysis of the safety and robustness of LLMs regarding the position of explicit normal instructions, word replacements (verbs in explicit normal instructions, target groups in malicious instructions, cue words for explicit normal instructions), and instruction replacements (different explicit normal instructions). Our results demonstrate that current LLMs not only prioritize certain instruction verbs but also exhibit varying jailbreak rates for different instruction verbs in explicit normal instructions.

To solve the challenge, agents need to have strong arithmetic, inference, exploration, and planning capabilities, while seamlessly integrating them. Via a systematic zero-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting (CoT), we show that agents can negotiate and consistently reach successful deals. We quantify the performance with multiple metrics and observe a large gap between GPT-4 and earlier models. Importantly, we test the generalization to new games and setups. Finally, we show that these games can help evaluate other critical aspects, such as the interaction dynamics between agents in the presence of greedy and adversarial players.",

In this paper, we propose a framework that lays a foundation for LLM platform designers to analyze and improve the security, privacy, and safety of current and future plugin-integrated LLM platforms.

As part of our iterative process, we apply our framework in the context of OpenAI's plugin ecosystem.

      "abstract": "This paper introduces RiskCards, a framework for structured assessment and documentation of risks associated with an application of language models. As with all language, text generated by language models can be harmful, or used to bring about harm. Automating language generation adds both an element of scale and also more subtle or emergent undesirable tendencies to the generated text. Prior work establishes a wide variety of language model harms to many different actors: existing taxonomies identify categories of harms posed by language models; benchmarks establish automated tests of these harms; and documentation standards for models, tasks and datasets encourage transparent reporting. However, there is no risk-centric framework for documenting the complexity of a landscape in which some risks are shared across models and contexts, while others are specific, and where certain conditions may be required for risks to manifest as harms. RiskCards address this methodological gap by providing a generic framework for assessing the use of a given language model in a given scenario. Each RiskCard makes clear the routes for the risk to manifest harm, their placement in harm taxonomies, and example prompt-output pairs. While RiskCards are designed to be open-source, dynamic and participatory, we present a \"starter set\" of RiskCards taken from a broad literature survey, each of which details a concrete risk presentation. Language model RiskCards initiate a community knowledge base which permits the mapping of risks and harms to a specific model or its application scenario, ultimately contributing to a better, safer and shared understanding of the risk landscape.",

Prior work has introduced automated tools that elicit harmful outputs to identify these risks. While this is a valuable step toward securing models, these approaches rely on a pre-existing way to efficiently classify undesirable outputs. Using a pre-existing classifier does not allow for red-teaming to be tailored to the target model. Furthermore, when failures can be easily classified in advance, red-teaming has limited marginal value because problems can be avoided by simply filtering training data and/or model outputs. Here, we consider red-teaming \"from scratch,\" in which the adversary does not begin with a way to classify failures. Our framework consists of three steps: 1) Exploring the model's range of behaviors in the desired context; 2) Establishing a definition and measurement for undesired behavior (e.g., a classifier trained to reflect human evaluations); and 3) Exploiting the model's flaws using this measure to develop diverse adversarial prompts. We use this approach to red-team GPT-3 to discover classes of inputs that elicit false statements. In doing so, we construct the CommonClaim dataset of 20,000 statements labeled by humans as common-knowledge-true, common knowledge-false, or neither. We are making code and data available.",

As part of our conversations, there’s been a bit of debate around what’s considered a vulnerability and what’s considered a feature of how LLMs operate. So I figured now would be a good time to take a stab at building a high-level threat model to suss out these differences and contribute to a greater understanding of LLMs in a security context. I’d also like for this post to act as a starting point for anyone interested in building or deploying their own LLM applications.",

      "abstract": "The Large Language Models (LLMs) are poised to offer efficient and intelligent services for future mobile communication networks, owing to their exceptional capabilities in language comprehension and generation. However, the extremely high data and computational resource requirements for the performance of LLMs compel developers to resort to outsourcing training or utilizing third-party data and computing resources. These strategies may expose the model within the network to maliciously manipulated training data and processing, providing an opportunity for attackers to embed a hidden backdoor into the model, termed a backdoor attack. Backdoor attack in LLMs refers to embedding a hidden backdoor in LLMs that causes the model to perform normally on benign samples but exhibit degraded performance on poisoned ones. This issue is particularly concerning within communication networks where reliability and security are paramount. Despite the extensive research on backdoor attacks, there remains a lack of in-depth exploration specifically within the context of LLMs employed in communication networks, and a systematic review of such attacks is currently absent. In this survey, we systematically propose a taxonomy of backdoor attacks in LLMs as used in communication networks, dividing them into four major categories: input-triggered, prompt-triggered, instruction-triggered, and demonstration-triggered attacks. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the benchmark datasets. Finally, we identify potential problems and open challenges, offering valuable insights into future research directions for enhancing the security and integrity of LLMs in communication networks.",

This paper discussed the relevant literature, reports, and explanatory incident attacks generated against chatbots. Our initial point is to explore the timeline of chatbots from ELIZA (an early natural language processing computer program) to GPT-4 and provide the working mechanism of ChatGPT. Subsequently, we explored the cybersecurity attacks and vulnerabilities in chatbots. Besides, we investigated the ChatGPT, specifically in the context of creating the malware code, phishing emails, undetectable zero-day attacks, and generation of macros and LOLBINs. Furthermore, the history of cyberattacks and vulnerabilities exploited by cybercriminals are discussed, particularly considering the risk and vulnerabilities in ChatGPT. Addressing these threats and vulnerabilities requires specific strategies and measures to reduce the harmful consequences. Therefore, the future directions to address the challenges were presented.",

      "abstract": "Every major technical invention resurfaces the dual-use dilemma -- the new technology has the potential to be used for good as well as for harm. Generative AI (GenAI) techniques, such as large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, have shown remarkable capabilities (e.g., in-context learning, code-completion, and text-to-image generation and editing). However, GenAI can be used just as well by attackers to generate new attacks and increase the velocity and efficacy of existing attacks.\nThis paper reports the findings of a workshop held at Google (co-organized by Stanford University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison) on the dual-use dilemma posed by GenAI. This paper is not meant to be comprehensive, but is rather an attempt to synthesize some of the interesting findings from the workshop.

Consequently, both academia and industry begin to emphasize the trustworthiness of generative data, successively providing a series of countermeasures for security and privacy. In this survey, we systematically review the security and privacy on generative data in AIGC, particularly for the first time analyzing them from the perspective of information security properties. Specifically, we reveal the successful experiences of state-of-the-art countermeasures in terms of the foundational properties of privacy, controllability, authenticity, and compliance, respectively.

      "abstract": "Deep learning has gained tremendous success and great popularity in the past few years. However, deep learning systems are suffering several inherent weaknesses, which can threaten the security of learning models. Deep learning's wide use further magnifies the impact and consequences. To this end, lots of research has been conducted with the purpose of exhaustively identifying intrinsic weaknesses and subsequently proposing feasible mitigation. Yet few are clear about how these weaknesses are incurred and how effective these attack approaches are in assaulting deep learning. In order to unveil the security weaknesses and aid in the development of a robust deep learning system, we undertake an investigation on attacks towards deep learning, and analyze these attacks to conclude some findings in multiple views. In particular, we focus on four types of attacks associated with security threats of deep learning: model extraction attack, model inversion attack, poisoning attack and adversarial attack. For each type of attack, we construct its essential workflow as well as adversary capabilities and attack goals. Pivot metrics are devised for comparing the attack approaches, by which we perform quantitative and qualitative analyses. From the analysis, we have identified significant and indispensable factors in an attack vector, e.g., how to reduce queries to target models, what distance should be used for measuring perturbation. We shed light on 18 findings covering these approaches' merits and demerits, success probability, deployment complexity and prospects. Moreover, we discuss other potential security weaknesses and possible mitigation which can inspire relevant research in this area.",

In particular, we consider these impacts from a multi-disciplinary perspective: computer science, sociology, environmental science, and so on to discuss its inter-connected societal risks and inability to simultaneously satisfy aspects of well-being. Therefore, we accentuate the necessity of holistically addressing pressing concerns of AI systems from a socioethical impact assessment perspective to explicate its harmful societal effects to truly enable humanity-centered Trustworthy AI.",

      "abstract": "Advanced AI models hold the promise of tremendous benefits for humanity, but society needs to proactively manage the accompanying risks. In this paper, we focus on what we term \"frontier AI\" models: highly capable foundation models that could possess dangerous capabilities sufficient to pose severe risks to public safety. Frontier AI models pose a distinct regulatory challenge: dangerous capabilities can arise unexpectedly; it is difficult to robustly prevent a deployed model from being misused; and, it is difficult to stop a model's capabilities from proliferating broadly. To address these challenges, at least three building blocks for the regulation of frontier models are needed: (1) standard-setting processes to identify appropriate requirements for frontier AI developers, (2) registration and reporting requirements to provide regulators with visibility into frontier AI development processes, and (3) mechanisms to ensure compliance with safety standards for the development and deployment of frontier AI models. Industry self-regulation is an important first step. However, wider societal discussions and government intervention will be needed to create standards and to ensure compliance with them. We consider several options to this end, including granting enforcement powers to supervisory authorities and licensure regimes for frontier AI models. Finally, we propose an initial set of safety standards. These include conducting pre-deployment risk assessments; external scrutiny of model behavior; using risk assessments to inform deployment decisions; and monitoring and responding to new information about model capabilities and uses post-deployment. We hope this discussion contributes to the broader conversation on how to balance public safety risks and innovation benefits from advances at the frontier of AI development.",
